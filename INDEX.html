    <h2>AKAN NAME GENERATOR</h2>
    <p>The Akan  people are a kwa group living primarily in present-day Ghana and in parts of Ivory Coast and Togo in West Africa. The Akan language (also known as Twi/Fante) are a group of dialects within the  branch of the Potou–Tano subfamily of the Niger–Congo family.
  </p>
  <p>The Akan people of Ghana frequently name their children after the day of the week they were born and the order in which they were born. These "day names" have further meanings concerning the soul and character of the person. Middle names have considerably more variety and can refer to their birth order, twin status, or an ancestor's middle name</p>
